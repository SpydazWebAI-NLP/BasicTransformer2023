## Single Layer Neural Network (VB.NET)
This repository contains an implementation of a single-layer neural network in Visual Basic (.NET). The neural network is designed for simple classification tasks and demonstrates the principles of forward and backward propagation.

## Features
Implements a single-layer neural network with customizable activation functions.
Supports various transfer functions, including Sigmoid, Hyperbolic Tangent, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and Softmax.
Provides functions for training the neural network using different learning algorithms, such as Sigmoid Training and Softmax Training.
Includes utility functions for matrix operations, error calculations, and weight initialization.
Getting Started
To get started with the single-layer neural network, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
Visual Studio or any compatible VB.NET development environment.
Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/single-layer-neural-network.git
Open the project in your VB.NET development environment.
## Usage
The main code file, SingleLayerNeuralNetwork.vb, contains the implementation of the single-layer neural network class. The class provides various functions for training and using the neural network.

Here are the main functions:

TrainSigmoid: Trains the neural network using the Sigmoid activation function.
TrainSoftMax: Trains the neural network using the Softmax activation function.
TrainRNN: Trains the neural network using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture.
Forward: Performs the forward pass of the neural network.
Backward: Performs the backward pass of the neural network to update weights.
ComputeTotalError: Calculates the total error of the neural network.
Refer to the code comments and function signatures for more details on how to use these functions.
